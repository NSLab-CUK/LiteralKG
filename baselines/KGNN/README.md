Figure 1 shows the overview of KGNN. It takes the parsed DDI matrix and knowledge graph obtained from preprocessing of dataset as the input. It outputs the interaction value for the drug-drug pair. 

# Requirement
To run the code, you need the following dependencies:
* Python == 3.6.6
* Keras == 2.3.0
* Tensorflow == 1.13.1
* scikit-learn == 0.22

# Installation
You can create a virtual environment using [conda](https://github.com/conda/conda).
```bash
conda create -n kgnn python=3.6.6  
source activate kgnn  
git clone https://github.com/xzenglab/KGNN.git  
cd KGNN  
pip install -r requirement.txt  
```

# Dataset
We just provide the preprocessed KG from KEGG-drug dataset owing to the size limited. And you can directly download the original DrugBank dataset ([V5.1.4](https://www.drugbank.ca/releases/5-1-4)). Note that the construction of KG please refer to [Bio2RDF](https://github.com/bio2rdf/bio2rdf-scripts/wiki) tool in detail.

# Usage
```bash
python run.py
```
